## Declaring variables with 'let'

'let' is a keyword which replaces 'var' for declaration of variables.
As we know with var there is a problem related to scope visibility and the second declaration
which is only in JavaScript which for many people that come for other languages this leads to unexpected issues.(check ex02.js)

'let' limits the variables to the scope that they are declared to.

## declaring constant variables('const');
constant is a variable which value never changes
If we try to change the value we will receive an error.For global variables is advisable to use constants.

## Template literals(ex05.js)
